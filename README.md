# Calisthenics vs. Weight Training: Which Builds Strength Faster?

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the differences between calisthenics and weight training, focusing on how quickly individuals progress in difficulty levels. The findings provide insights into which training method allows for faster progression, helping fitness enthusiasts make informed decisions.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: `megaGymDataset.csv`
- **Size**: 2,918 exercise entries
- **Columns**:
  - `Title`: Name of the exercise
  - `Desc`: Description of the exercise
  - `Type`: Strength, flexibility, or cardio
  - `BodyPart`: Muscle group targeted
  - `Equipment`: Equipment used (e.g., "Body Only" for calisthenics)
  - `Level`: Beginner, Intermediate, or Expert
  - `Rating`: User ratings for the exercise

## 🔍 Key Analyses

1. **Data Overview**: Examined dataset structure and missing values.
2. **Exercise Categorization**:
   - Calisthenics: Exercises requiring no equipment ("Body Only").
   - Weight Training: Exercises involving external weights or machines.
3. **Difficulty Level Analysis**:
   - Counted the number of exercises at Beginner, Intermediate, and Expert levels.
   - Compared the distribution of difficulty levels for both training methods.
4. **Progression Ratios**:
   - Measured how many people transition from one difficulty level to another.
   - Calculated Beginner-to-Intermediate and Intermediate-to-Expert progression ratios.
5. **Visualization**:
   - Bar charts comparing difficulty level distribution for calisthenics vs. weight training.
   - A progression ratio comparison chart.

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Beginner-to-Intermediate progression:**
  - Calisthenics: **9.35x**
  - Weight Training: **4.58x**
- **Intermediate-to-Expert progression:**
  - Calisthenics: **0.003x**
  - Weight Training: **0.0069x**
- **Conclusions:**
  - Calisthenics enables faster early progression compared to weight training.
  - Advancing to expert level is difficult in both methods.
  - Weight training offers a more gradual and structured difficulty progression.

## 📌 Key Takeaway

- If you want **rapid early progression**, calisthenics may be the better choice.
- If you prefer a **gradual difficulty increase**, weight training might be ideal.


🚀 *Happy Training!* 💪
